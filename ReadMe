Executing the Program:

There are two files: makefile and algorithm.cpp

Step 1: Write make in cmd
(This will compile algorithm.cpp source file to an executable named AlgoTowers)

Step 2: Running the program

1) AlgoTowers TaskNumber Input_File
Example: AlgoTowers 2 10x10
(This will write the output in the console, the output will be the top-left and bottom-right corners of the optimal rectangle/sqaure)
